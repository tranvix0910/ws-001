### Introduction to DevSecOps
**DevSecOps** is a method that integrates security testing at every stage of the software development process. This method includes tools and processes that encourage collaboration between developers, security experts, and operations teams to build both efficient and secure software. DevSecOps brings cultural transformation, making security a shared responsibility for everyone involved in software development.

**DevSecOps** stands for development, security, and operations. It is an extension of the DevOps methodology. Each term defines the distinct roles and responsibilities of software teams in building applications.

**Development**

Development is the process of planning, coding, building, and testing applications.

**Security**

Security means introducing security earlier in the software development lifecycle. For example, developers ensure the code is free from security vulnerabilities, and security practitioners further check the software before the company releases it.

**Operations**

The operations team releases, monitors, and fixes any issues that arise from the software.
