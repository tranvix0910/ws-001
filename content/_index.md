# Implementing the DevSecOps Pipeline
### Overview
In this workshop, you will learn the basics of the DevSecOps process — the integration of development (Dev), operations (Ops), and security (Sec) to build a comprehensive and secure CI/CD pipeline. The workshop will guide you through using tools such as GitLab CI/CD, Docker, Portus, and k6 to implement effective DevSecOps solutions on both On-Premise and AWS Cloud infrastructures.
